This code is a game of tic tac toe and this is the pseudo code for the game of tic tac toe

The breakdown I used while making this game was:
1. Initialize the board
2. Initalize the players
3. Draw the initial board for the players
4. Get the player information
    - Their names
    - Their character
    - Whether it's their turn or not
5. Get the players' chocie for their pieces
6. Check to see if their spots were valid
7. Check to see if there was a possible win
8. Decide the winner

Classes will allow me to organize the code better and will group the varaibles and also the functions according to the class 

More indepth pseudocode:

Define the two classes:
- Player
- TicTacToe (the main game)

PLAYER CLASS:
- CONSTRUCTOR:
    The Constructor will take in a playerName (string), theirCharacter (a character), and theirTurn (a boolean)
    
- METHOD: placePiece
    The placePiece method will check to see if the row/column is in the range of the board and if it's not it will return a suitable response.
    If the given row and column is available on the board it will then replace it with the respective player's character.
     How do we know if the place is viable? The spot on the board IF it's viable will be holding the "-" character
    If the given row and column is NOT available, it returns that the spot on the board is not available

TICTACTOE CLASS:
- CONSTRUCTOR:
    The constructor will take in two players, initialize the board and the size of the board
    WIN CHECKING SETUP:
        Setting up all of the respective arrays for each row and column and diagonal
        Each count (row count, col count, LR count, RL count) holds how many X's and O's are in each row/col/diagonal
    The constructor also initializes the current player to Player one
        THIS MEANS PLAYER ONE WILL ALWAYS GO FIRST

- METHOD: placePiece
    The placePiece method will check to see if the player's place piece function is true or false (if it's correctly placed or not)
    If the piece is placed correctly it will then update the respective array counters with the count of that player's character
    The placePiece function will also check to see if there is a potential win or not.
    If there is a win then it will return true with a message
    If not then the player will then change to the other player

- METHOD: updateCounters
    The updateCounters method will take in the row, col and char which will the nupdate the arrays we previously initialized that will indicate whether there was a win or not in a respective row/column.

- METHOD: checkWin
    The checkWin returns true if any of the arrays at any index equal to three

- METHOD: displayBoard
    Self explanatory

MAIN GAME:
The main game will ask the players to enter their names
Then their information is printed into the terminal
The main game will then initialize a new game of TicTacToe passing in the two players.
It also then displays the board and then enters a gameloop function which is recursive.
It recursively asks the player to enter a row and column and then will return out of the if statement and then the function when the game finishes.
